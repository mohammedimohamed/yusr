# Yusr Ecosystem

**Yusr** (يسر) — meaning "ease" in Arabic, inspired by the promise of simplicity — is a development ecosystem that lets you focus on building what matters. With a stable core and dynamic extensions, Yusr eliminates boilerplate so you can start creating business solutions right away. From frontend to backend, it’s designed to grow with you, not against you.

## The Vision

Imagine a house: a strong foundation you build once, with rooms you add as needed. That’s Yusr:
- **Start Easy**: A ready-to-use core with standard features—navigation, module loading, and more.
- **Stay Stable**: Deploy the foundation once; updates live in modules, not the core.
- **Grow Freely**: Add business logic through modules, APIs, and future components—no rebuilds required.

Rooted in the Arabic Islamic value of "Yusr" (ease), this ecosystem is for developers who want simplicity without compromise.

## What You Get

- **Yusr Frontend**: A React app with Web Component modules—stable and modular.
- **Yusr API**: A growing backend for seamless integration (in progress).
- **More to Come**: Database, middleware, and beyond—all keeping the same vision.

## Editions

- **Community Edition**: Free and open source under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Perfect for individuals, startups, and open projects.
